# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

In this Project I was tasked with creating a team profile generator using node.js object oriented programming and Javascript. This generator takes in a users inputs for a manager and their choice of either engineer and/or intern in the terminal command line and pastes given inputs to a HTML template in order to simplify and speed up the profile building process for each given employee.
